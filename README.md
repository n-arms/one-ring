# one-ring
A chrome extension to put an end to the fires of Mount Doom-scrolling YouTube shorts :)

One Ring gives you 60 seconds of scrolling through YouTube shorts before it cuts you off with a message reminding you to take care of yourself and consider doing something else.

One Ring isn't on the chrome extension store, but you can add it to your browser locally by turning on developer mode and loading it as an unpacked extension.
